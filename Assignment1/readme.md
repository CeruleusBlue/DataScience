# Big Data Mining Techniques and Implementation
# Assignment 1
## Task 1

### Dataset: 

There  are  two  files  in  this  dataset.  
1.  **train.csv** - contains  81  features  extracted  from  21263  superconductors along with the critical temperature in the last column 
2. **unique_m.csv** - contains the chemical formula broken up for all the 21263 superconductors from the train.csv file. 

### Objective:

The objective of this task is to develop an end-to-end data mining project by using the Python machine learning library Scikit-Learn. The task is to predict critical temperature in the superconductivity data. 


## Task 2

### Dataset:
Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools. There are 8 attributes and 1 target variable, which are categorical or integer. The last target variable (i.e., the application ranking) includes 5 classes: 
[“not_recom”, “recommend”, “very_recom”,“priority” and “spec_prior”]  

### Objective:
The objective of the task is to implement a Decision Tree from scratch to predict the application rankings without using any machine learning library.
